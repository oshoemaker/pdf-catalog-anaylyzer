## ðŸ“š Detailed Setup Options

Choose the method that best fits your experience level and preferences:

### Option 1: Python Virtual Environment (Recommended)
### Option 2: macOS with Homebrew
### Option 3: Docker (Cross-Platform)

---

## Option 1: Python Virtual Environment Setup (Recommended)

This is the recommended approach for this project as it isolates dependencies and matches the project structure.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system
- Basic command line familiarity

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Check Python Installation
```bash
python3 --version
```
If this doesn't work, you need to install Python first:
- **macOS**: Install via Homebrew: `brew install python3`
- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **Linux**: Use your package manager: `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv`

#### 2. Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/pdf-catalog-anaylyzer
```

#### 3. Use the Project's Automated Setup
```bash
# Option A: Full automated setup
chmod +x setup_project.sh
./setup_project.sh

# Option B: Manual virtual environment setup
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Activate Environment (for future sessions)
```bash
# Use the project's activation script
source activate_venv.sh

# Or manually activate
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 5. Start Jupyter
```bash
jupyter lab
```

### Environment Variables Setup
1. Create your environment file:
   ```bash
   # The setup script will create .env.example for you, then copy it
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` with your API keys:
   ```bash
   # Add your API keys here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key_here
   ```

---

## Option 2: macOS with Homebrew

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Homebrew installed
- No prior Python/Jupyter experience needed

### Complete Installation Steps

#### 1. Install Homebrew (if not installed)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### 2. Install Python and Package Manager
```bash
# Install Python 3
brew install python3

# Install pipx for Python application management
brew install pipx
```

#### 3. Install Jupyter with Dependencies
```bash
# Install Jupyter with all scientific computing packages
pipx install --include-deps jupyter

# Add pipx to your PATH
pipx ensurepath
```

#### 4. Restart Terminal
```bash
# Restart your terminal or run:
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc depending on your shell
```

#### 5. Navigate to Project and Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /path/to/pdf-catalog-anaylyzer

# Install project-specific dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 6. Start Jupyter
```bash
jupyter lab
```

---

## Option 3: Docker Setup (Cross-Platform)

Perfect if you want a completely isolated environment or have issues with Python installation.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- No Python knowledge required

### Step-by-Step Docker Setup

#### 1. Install Docker Desktop
- Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Install and start Docker Desktop
- Verify installation: `docker --version`

#### 2. Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/pdf-catalog-anaylyzer
```

#### 3. Run Jupyter in Docker
```bash
# Pull and run Jupyter with scientific packages
docker run -p 8888:8888 \
  -v "$(pwd)":/home/jovyan/work \
  --name jupyter-pdf-analyzer \
  jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest
```

#### 4. Access Jupyter Lab
1. Watch the terminal output for a line like:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=abc123...
   ```
2. Copy this URL and open it in your browser
3. Your project files will be in the `work` directory

#### 5. Managing the Docker Container
```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop jupyter-pdf-analyzer

# Start existing container
docker start jupyter-pdf-analyzer

# View logs (to get the access token again)
docker logs jupyter-pdf-analyzer

# Remove container (when done)
docker rm jupyter-pdf-analyzer
```

## Using the Project

Once Jupyter is running, you can access the project notebooks:

### Available Notebooks
1. **`01_pdf_catalog_analyzer.ipynb`** - Basic PDF analysis
2. **`02_simple_pdf_analyzer.ipynb`** - Simplified analysis workflow  
3. **`03_production_ai_agent.ipynb`** - Advanced AI-powered analysis

### Getting Started
1. Open Jupyter Lab in your browser
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder
3. Start with `01_pdf_catalog_analyzer.ipynb` for a basic introduction
4. Place your PDF files in the `pdfs/` directory
5. Run the cells in order by pressing `Shift + Enter`

### Project Structure
```
pdf-catalog-anaylyzer/
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks
â”œâ”€â”€ pdfs/              # Place your PDF files here
â”œâ”€â”€ extracted_data/    # Analysis results (tracked in git)
â”œâ”€â”€ output/            # CSV exports and reports
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/              # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ .env              # Your API keys (copy from .env.example)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Command not found: jupyter"
- **Virtual Environment**: Make sure you activated it: `source activate_venv.sh`
- **macOS/Homebrew**: Run `pipx ensurepath` and restart terminal
- **Docker**: Use the docker command instead of local jupyter

#### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Virtual Environment
source activate_venv.sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

# System-wide installation
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Port 8888 already in use
```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -ti:8888 | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
jupyter lab --port 8889
```

#### Docker permission issues
```bash
# On Linux, you might need to add your user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then logout and login again
```

#### Can't access files in Docker
- Make sure you're running docker from the project directory
- Files should appear in the `work` folder within Jupyter
- Use absolute paths in the volume mount if needed

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error messages carefully
2. Ensure all prerequisites are installed
3. Try the automated setup script: `./setup_project.sh`
4. For Docker issues, restart Docker Desktop
5. For Python issues, try creating a fresh virtual environment

## Verification Steps

Test that everything works:

### 1. Create a Test Notebook
1. In Jupyter, create a new Python 3 notebook
2. Run these test commands:

```python
# Test 1: Basic Python
print("Hello, PDF Analyzer!")

# Test 2: Import core libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
print("âœ… Core libraries imported successfully")

# Test 3: Import PDF processing libraries
import PyMuPDF as fitz
import pdfplumber
print("âœ… PDF libraries imported successfully")

# Test 4: Check project structure
import os
print("Current directory:", os.getcwd())
print("Available files:", os.listdir('.'))
```

### 2. Verify Environment
```python
# Check Python version and packages
import sys
print("Python version:", sys.version)

# List installed packages
import pkg_resources
packages = [d.project_name for d in pkg_resources.working_set]
print(f"âœ… {len(packages)} packages installed")
```

If all commands run without errors, your setup is complete! ðŸŽ‰
